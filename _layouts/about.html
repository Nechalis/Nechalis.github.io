		<h1>Major info:</h1>
			<p>"I'm a young programmer hailing from Partiz√°nske, Slovakia. The closest to my heart call me Daniel and I'm currently studying the third year of informatics on Slovak Technical University - Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies in the capital and biggest city Bratislava. I'm fond of programming in object-oriented languages like c# with little skill in the field of web-development. Other than that I'm keen on playing floorball, playing video-games or just hanging out with my friends. If you like what you see, feel free to contact me on daniel.nechala102@gmail.com"</p>
